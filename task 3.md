> summary of our implementations :

### - first we draw a floor and then using texture mapping we added 3 different textures to the floor, and by clicking right mouse button we can change between them.

### - then we loaded our robot that we implemented in task 2, also we loaded a sofa, table and mug so the robot will move from the sofa to the table to take his coffee.
